# epics7WithRtems5ForMvme3100
Epics7 (epics-base) for use with RTEMS5 and MVME3100 (for Miroslaw)


Hello Miroslaw,
unfortunately I don't know exactly how to get this. You can clone it and then you need to do
"git checkout 7.0".

The bash script "INSTALLING_5_MASTER" can be used to install RTEMS5 for mvme3100. It contains as 
here document my small changes for the i2c devices.

Have fun/success with it.
